          remediation: 'Use your package manager to update all packages on the system according to site policy.
                        Run the following command to update all packages following local site policy guidance on applying updates and patches:
                        # apt upgrade
                        OR

                            upgrade: upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list.
                             Packages currently installed with new versions available are retrieved and upgraded;
                             under no circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages not already installed retrieved and installed.
                             New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without changing the install status of another package will be left at their current version.
                              An update must be performed first so that apt knows that new versions of packages are available.
                            dist-upgrade: dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages;
                             apt has a "smart" conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary.
                              So, dist-upgrade command may remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for overriding the general settings for individual packages.'
