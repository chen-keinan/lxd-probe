          description: A network port is identified by its number, the associated IP address, and the type of the communication protocol such as TCP or UDP.
                      A listening port is a network port on which an application or process listens on, acting as a communication endpoint.
                      Each listening port can be open or closed (filtered) using a firewall.
                      In general terms, an open port is a network port that accepts incoming packets from remote locations.
