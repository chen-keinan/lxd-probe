          description: Many Linux distributions provide value-added firewall solutions which provide easy,
                      advanced management of network traffic into and out of the local system.
                      When these solutions are available and appropriate for an environment they should be used.
                      In cases where a value-added firewall is not provided by a distribution, TCP Wrappers provides a simple access list
                      and standardized logging method for services capable of supporting it.
                      Services that are called from inetd and xinetd support the use of TCP wrappers.
                      Any service that can support TCP wrappers will have the libwrap.so library attached to it.

                          If there is any output, then the service supports TCP Wrappers.'
