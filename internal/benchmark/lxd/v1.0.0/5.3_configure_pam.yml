          description: The pam_pwquality.so module checks the strength of passwords. It performs checks such as making sure a password is not
                        a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix of characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more.
                        The following are definitions of the pam_pwquality.so options.
                        The following options are set in the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file Password Length
                        minlen = 14 - password must be 14 characters or more Password complexity
                        minclass = 4 - The minimum number of required classes of characters for the new password (digits, uppercase, lowercase, others)
                        OR
                        dcredit = -1 - provide at least one digit
                        ucredit = -1 - provide at least one uppercase character
                        ocredit = -1 - provide at least one special character
                        lcredit = -1 - provide at least one lowercase character
                        The following is st in the /etc/pam.d/common-password file
                        retry=3 - Allow 3 tries before sending back a failure.
                        The settings shown above are one possible policy.
                        Alter these values to conform to your own organization's password policies.
